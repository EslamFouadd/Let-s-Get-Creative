# This is a set of class notes for an Algebra course taught at Lamar University.
# While primarily intended for students, it's designed to be accessible to anyone
# wanting to learn or refresh their understanding of Algebra.

# Warning to students:
# 1. These notes include material that may not always be covered in class, so it's
#    important to check with classmates if there are any differences between the notes
#    and what was taught.
# 2. Not all problems covered in these notes will necessarily be worked in class.
# 3. Class discussions may lead to insights not included in these notes, so it's
#    beneficial to compare notes with classmates to ensure a comprehensive understanding.
# 4. These notes are not a substitute for attending class; they're meant to supplement
#    classroom learning and provide additional examples and explanations.

# The notes cover a range of Algebra topics, assuming some prior exposure to basic
# algebraic concepts such as exponents, factoring, and graphing.

# Note: Python code will not be included here as the notes are primarily descriptive.
# However, examples and exercises could be provided as Python code snippets to illustrate
# algebraic concepts and problem-solving techniques.
